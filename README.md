# What-Went-Wrong
What Went Wrong is a 2D puzzle comic game using gesture recognition. This game focuses on 3 friends and their emotions through a shift in friendship between them. As the player learns more about the characters through their interaction and their thoughts in the diary page, they use these emotions to solve the puzzle through gestures.
